  Arrays
1) Sort
2) Two Pointer


  LinkedList
1) fast and slow -> while (fast && fast.next)
2) Adding a dummy in fornt to avoid corner cases
3) Merge two sorted Linked LinkedLists in Bactracking technique
4) Reverse Values b/w left and right
     apply for loop -> left - 1 = temp;
     reverse from temp -> right - left + 1;
     adjust
5) Reverse in K groups -> O(n2) 
6) Remove Duplicates
    - add a dummy
    while(temp.next && temp.next.next)
7) Partition List for a value X 
   where values less go to left and greater go to right
   use two dummy nodes and append values to them as you traverse
   based on lesser or greater then join them
